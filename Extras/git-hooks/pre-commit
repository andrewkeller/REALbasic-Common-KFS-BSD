#  A Pre-Commit Hook for Git that makes sure that no REALStudio files
#  are about to get committed while having Mac OS 9 (CR) line endings.

#  Created 4/2/2010 by Andrew Keller.

#  Exit 1 if any RB VCP files contian CR line endings, and 0 otherwise.

#  Known bug: This script does not work with the initial commit.

			<h2>BSDGlobalsKFS_String <span class=cd>(Module)</span></h2>
			<p>This module contains items that aid with String processing.</p>
			
			<h2>Constants</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>EndOfLineKFS</h1>
					<h2>EndOfLineKFS As String</h2>
					<p>Same as RB's EndOfLine, but returns a Unix EOL on OS X.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>EndOfLineSetKFS</h1>
					<h2>EndOfLineSetKFS As String()</h2>
					<p>Returns the set of all EndOfLine's.  Windows, then Unix, then Mac Classic, in that order.  Useful with string utilities that can handle more than one delimiter at a time.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1><span class=cd>BinaryStream</span>.InStrB_BSa_KFS</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>BinaryStream</span>.InStrB_BSa_KFS( ByRef regionStart As UInt64, ByRef regionEnd As UInt64, ByRef matchIndex As Integer, startPos As UInt64, subStrings() As BinaryStream ) As UInt64</h2>
					<p>Returns the position of the highest priority delimiter in the first clump of delimiters found in the given source string.  The region start and end parameters are used to return the position of the start and end of the region where the first clump of delimiters were found, and the matchIndex parameter is used to return the index of the delimiter that was identified as "the match"  This delimiter is always inside the delimiter region.  Priorities of delimiters are assigned by the order of items in the subStrings array, with the first item being the highest priority.</p>
					<p>A common use of this function would be to parse text by lines, without having to know what line endings are used.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1><span class=cd>Variant</span>.DescriptionKFS</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Variant</span>.DescriptionKFS As String</h2>
					<p>Returns a textual representation of the given Variant for use with sentences.  For example, strings are in quotes, numbers are not, and zero, the empty string, True, and False are all written out, and the class name of the object is returned when Variant.StringValue fails.</p>

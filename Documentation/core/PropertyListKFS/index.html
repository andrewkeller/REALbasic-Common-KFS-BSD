			<h2>PropertyListKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>This class is similar to the Dictionary, except that it is more designed to deal with hierarchal key/value-based data structures.  This class uses the Dictionary as the core data storage.</p>
			
			<h2>Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>[default]</h1>
					<h2>New PropertyListKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new empty PropertyListKFS object.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Pair()</h1>
					<h2>New PropertyListKFS( entries() As Pair )</h2>
					<h2>New PropertyListKFS( entry1 As Pair, ParamArray entries As Pair )</h2>
					<p>Creates a new PropertyListKFS object that contains the given key-value pairs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>PropertyListKFS</h1>
					<h2>New PropertyListKFS( other As PropertyListKFS )</h2>
					<p>Creates a new PropertyListKFS object that contains a clone of the data in the given PropertyListKFS object.  Identical in operation to the Clone method, except that passing Nil as an argument will result in a new, empty PropertyListKFS object.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Shared Methods Used as Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>NewPListFromClone</h1>
					<h2>NewPListFromClone( other As PropertyListKFS ) As PropertyListKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a clone of the given PropertyListKFS object.  Always returns a non-Nil result.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>NewPListWithDataCore</h1>
					<h2>NewPListWithDataCore( d As Dictionary ) As PropertyListKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a new PropertyListKFS object with the given data core.  If Nil is provided, then the data core is set to a new Dictionary object.  Always returns a non-Nil result.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Convert Constructors</h2>
			<div class="convgraph">
				<div class="in">
					<h1>Dictionary</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="center"><p>PropertyListKFS</p></div>
				<div class="out">
					<h1>Dictionary</h1>
				</div>
				<p>When converting to or from a Dictionary object, the data core is dealt with.  The core is either acquired, or returned.  The data core is never cloned when using this syntax.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Child</h1>
					<h2>Child( key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant ) As PropertyListKFS</h2>
					<h2>Child( key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant, Assigns newChild As PropertyListKFS )</h2>
					<p>Returns or assigns the child referenced by the given series of keys.  The getter will return Nil if the given series of keys do not address a real location in the hierarchy, or if the value addressed is terminal rather than a child.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Clone</h1>
					<h2>Clone() As PropertyListKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a clone of the current PropertyListKFS object.  The result is completely independent of the original, except for any objects you put in the hierarchy yourself.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Import</h1>
					<h2>Import( other As PropertyListKFS )</h2>
					<p>Copies the data in the given tree into the current tree.  The Clone function uses this method to do its work.</p>
					<p>This operation is closed under homomorphism.  Although this is an interesting feature, it was achieved primarily to avoid a StackOverflowException in the case that there are loops in the source tree.  Because of this ability, any operation that uses this method to copy a tree is automatically able to preserve loops in the tree.  This includes the Clone method, the clone constructor, the shared clone constructor, and the Pair constructor.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Remove</h1>
					<h2>Remove( prune As Boolean, key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant )</h2>
					<p>Unlinks the key addressed by the given series of keys from the hierarchy.  If the given series of keys do not address a real location in the hierarchy, no action is taken.</p>
					<p>The boolean parameter denotes whether or not to unlink directories that became empty because of the given removal.  For example, if removing the key "foo" from a folder results in the folder being empty, if prune is True, the enclosing folder will also be removed.  In other words, if this operation removes the last leaf on a branch, then the entire branch is also cut off.</p>
					<p>Pruning will only have an effect on children of the directory of which the Remove method was called.  For example, if you have a directory structure that is 5 levels deep, and you call Remove from the second level, targeting a 5th level node, then the Remove method could only remove at most levels 5, 4, and 3.  The function was called with the second level being the root level.  The Remove function cannot unlink a root directory.  The hierarchies are not doubly-linked, so there is no way to get the parent of a directory.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Value</h1>
					<h2>Value( key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant ) As Variant</h2>
					<h2>Value( key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant, Assigns newValue As Variant )</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets the value addressed by the given series of keys.  When getting a value, if the given series of keys do not address a real location in the hierarchy, or if the value addressed is a child rather than a terminal, then Nil is returned.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Wedge</h1>
					<h2>Wedge( newValue As Variant, key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant )</h2>
					<p>A specialized insertion method.</p>
					<p>If the last key in the given series of keys is not an integer, then this method adds the given value at the location addressed by the given series of keys.  In this case, this is just like setting a value using the Value method.</p>
					<p>If the last key in the given series of keys is an integer, then this method shifts all numeric keys that are adjacent to the last given key up by one in the directory addressed by the given series of keys, and inserts the given new value into the location addressed by the given series of keys.</p>
					<p>In either case, if the given series of keys do not address a real location in the hierarchy, then children are created to make the location exist.  If part or all of the series of keys points to a terminal value, then the terminal value is unlinked and a child is put in its place.</p>
					<p>For example, if a folder has the keys {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and you insert a value with the key {6}, then the keys {6, 7, 8} are shifted to {7, 8, 9}, and a new key {6} is inserted.  The resulting list of keys would be {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }.</p>
					<p>The Wedge method currently interprets the index as an Int64 value.  If the given index is not an integer, then the Wedge method defaults to the simple set case.  If an index is supplied that is larger or smaller than an Int64 can handle, then the value is truncated to the limit of an Int64 value.  If, in the process of shifting keys, the limit of an Int64 value is exceeded, an OutOfBoundsException is raised.</p>
					<p>It should be noted that the complexity of this method is O( n^2 * log(n) ).  As far as efficient data storage goes, that's actually pretty bad.  This method is nice for some simple tasks, but it should not be used for anything even resembling a high-performance environment.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>HasKey</h1>
					<h2>HasKey( key1 As Variant, ParamArray keyN As Variant ) As Boolean</h2>

					<h1>Values</h1>
					<h2>Values( ParamArray keyN As Variant ) As Variant()</h2>
					<p>Returns an array of the immediate terminal values in the folder addressed by the given series of keys.  Returns an empty array if the given series of keys do not address a real location in the hierarchy, or if the value addressed is terminal rather than a child.</p>

			</div>
			
			<h2>Operator Overloading</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;&gt;</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Compare(other As PropertyListKFS) As Integer</h2>
					<p>A PropertyListKFS object can be compared to another PropertyListKFS object.  Returns equal if one object could have been a clone of the other (ie, they happen to contain the same keys and values).  Returns not equal otherwise.  Currently, the sort order is undefined, so only '=' and '&lt;&gt;' are useful.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is not thread safe, however internally, it is quite resilient to unexpected data modifications.  In other words, this class should never raise an exception unexpectedly, however it would be advantageous to use locking mechanisms to ensure that the results of functions are still up-to-date when you go to act on them in subsequent lines of code.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is designed to represent a tree of data.  For simplicity however, the data is not required to be a tree.  This is so that methods like the Import method do not cause a StackOverflowException if there are loops in the tree.</p>
				<p>Although this class uses a Dictionary object for its storage, this class is not a subclass of the Dictionary, because of some shortcomings of the Dictionary class with regard to subclassing with the intent to form a tree of Dictionaries.  For example, the Count and BinCount properties are actual properties, so they cannot be overridden with a new version that can accept a series of keys.</p>
				<p>This class can, however be converted seamlessly to or from a Dictionary object.  When converting from a Dictionary object, the data core of the new PropertyListKFS object is the given Dictionary object.  When converting to a Dictionary, the data core of the PropertyListKFS object is returned, which is a Dictionary.  For example:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>// Create a Dictionary object:</p>
					<br />
					<p>Dim d As New Dictionary</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>// This Dictionary can be converted to a PropertyListKFS object.</p>
					<p>// The original Dictionary object becomes the data core of the new PropertyListKFS object.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Dim plist As PropertyListKFS = d</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>// Set some data in the property list:</p>
					<br />
					<p>plist.Value( "dir 1", "dir 2", "foo" ) = "bar"</p>
					<br />
					<p>// plist now contains a key "dir 1" pointing to a PropertyListKFS object</p>
					<p>//   with a key "dir 2" pointing to a PropertyListKFS object</p>
					<p>//   with a key "foo" pointing to a String "bar".</p>
					<br />
					<p>// Because plist is using d as the data core, d also contains the same data.</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>// Even so, we can still convert the PropertyListKFS object back to a Dictionary.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Dim core As Dictionary = plist</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>// core now contains the data core of plist, which is the same object as d.</p>
					<br />
					<p>// If more data were to be added to either d or core, then the new data would</p>
					<p>// be accessible from plist, since plist uses d (and core) as the data core object.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Another notable characteristic of the PropertyListKFS class is its behavior with regard to errors.  The PropertyListKFS class was written primarily for accessing property lists on a hard drive, such as preferences files.  When reading preferences files, keys can often be missing or the wrong type, because users sometimes edit them manually.  Because of this, this class is much more easy going than the Dictionary.  For example, if you try to get the value of the key "foo", and "foo" doesn't exist, then Nil is returned.  The only exception is the Key function, which raises exceptions just as easily as the Dictionary's Key function.  The following is an example of the difference in the mindsets between the Dictionary class and the PropertyListKFS class:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Dim d As New Dictionary</p>
					<br />
					<p>MsgBox d.Value( "foo" ).StringValue // Raises a KeyNotFoundException</p>
					<br />
					<p>Dim p As New PropertyListKFS</p>
					<br />
					<p>MsgBox p.Value( "foo" ).StringValue // Value() returns Nil, MsgBox displays an empty string</p>
				</div>
				<p>Another notable difference between the PropertyListKFS class and the Dictionary class is that when two PropertyListKFS objects are compared for equality, the contents of each entire hierarchy are compared.  This makes the comparison much slower, so be careful.  If you would like to compare object references rather than contents, use the Is operator.</p>

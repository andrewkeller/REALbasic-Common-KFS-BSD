			<h2>ProgressDelegateKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>This class allows multiple distinct distributed processes to report progress such that a single ProgressBar can be smoothly updated without any of the processes needing to know about each other.</p>
			<p>The basic idea is that you give a reference to a ProgressDelegateKFS that you've configured to update a ProgressBar to one of your processes.  Then, that process spawns a ProgressDelegateKFS child for every one of its subprocesses.  Then, the ProgressDelegateKFS class does the math for you to figure how far along your process is overall.  This technique creates a tree of distinct ProgressDelegateKFS objects, each of which is feeding information to the root, which updates your ProgressBar.</p>
			<p>Although this class was primarily designed for convenience and data organization, it was also designed with efficiency in mind.  It offers several operating modes that each have distinct speed advantages in different situations.  However, in true high performance computing, keep in mind that the fastest approach is always to manually throttle how often progress is reported.  This is true for all languages and all progress reporting mechanisms.</p>
			
			<h2>Delegates</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>BasicEventMethod</h1>
					<h2>BasicEventMethod( pgd As ProgressDelegateKFS )</h2>
					<p>The signature of callbacks and events used in this class.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Enumerations</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Modes</h1>
					<h2>Modes As Integer</h2>
					<p>Defines each possible mode of a ProgressDelegateKFS object.  Values include:
						<ul>
							<li>FullSynchronous</li>
							<li>ThrottledSynchronous</li>
							<li>InternalAsynchronous</li>
							<li>ExternalAsynchronous</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>FullSynchronous is where every update at any node gets propagated to the root node immediately.  This is the default.</p>
					<p>ThrottledSynchronous is where every update at any node gets propagated to the root node if the previous update was more than some time ago, where some time equals the Frequency property.</p>
					<p>InternalAsynchronous is where a timer is created internally with a period equal to the Frequency property, and updates are done whenever the timer goes off.</p>
					<p>ExternalAsynchronous is also known as the "Off" mode.  No action is ever taken automatically.  It is expected that you have some sort of mechanism external to this class that is routinely polling this class for its value and message.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Signals</h1>
					<h2>Signals As Integer</h2>
					<p>Defines each possible signal supported by the ProgressDelegateKFS class.  Values include:
						<ul>
							<li>Normal</li>
							<li>Pause</li>
							<li>Cancel</li>
							<li>Kill</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Signals do not "do" anything by themselves.  The intention of signals is to allow the user interface (or any node N in a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects) to send a message to the working processes (or all the children of node N).</p>
					<p>A working process can check for signals by either polling or by providing a callback to its local ProgressDelegateKFS object (or both).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Events</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>MessageChanged</h1>
					<h2>MessageChanged()</h2>
					<p>Invoked when the value of Message(True) changes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SignalChanged</h1>
					<h2>SignalChanged()</h2>
					<p>Invoked when the signal has changed.</p>
					<p>When a signal is set, the signal is propagated throughout the entire tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects before this event is raised.  This event is raised for every node where the signal actually changed, starting with the children, working down to the root node.  This event is not raised for nodes where setting the signal did not actually change the signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ValueChanged</h1>
					<h2>ValueChanged()</h2>
					<p>Invoked when the value of Value(True) or Indeterminate(True) changes.</p>

			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>ChildCount</h1>
					<h2>ChildCount() As Integer</h2>
					<p>Returns the number of ProgressDelegateKFS objects that are first children of this object.  This does not include past children which have been deallocated and no longer exist.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Children</h1>
					<h2>Children() As ProgressDelegateKFS()</h2>
					<p>Returns an array of the ProgressDelegateKFS objects that are first children of this object.  This does not include past children which have been deallocated and no longer exist.</p>
					<p>The order of the array is currently undefined.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Frequency</h1>
					<h2>Frequency() As DurationKFS</h2>
					<h2>Frequency( Assigns new_value As DurationKFS )</h2>
					<p>When in ThrottledSynchronous mode, this is the amount of time that must pass before a ValueChanged or MessageChanged event will be recognized.</p>
					<p>When in InternalAsynchronous mode, this is the frequency of the polling.</p>
					<p>In all other modes, this property is ignored.</p>
					<p>The object returned by this property is completely sanitized and decoupled from this class.  Changing its value does not change the value that this class will use for the Frequency.  To change the frequency, you must set the Frequency equal to an alternate DurationKFS object.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>IndeterminateValue</h1>
					<h2>IndeterminateValue( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<h2>IndeterminateValue( include_children As Boolean = True ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not progress cannot be determined.  Metaphorically equivalent to a ProgressBar object with the Maximum set to zero.  Default value is True.  Becomes False automatically if the Value property is set in any way, including via a child deallocating and incrementing the value of its parent.</p>
					<p>When in Synchronous mode, the value of this property is cached, and accessing this property only involves returning the cache.</p>
					<p>When in Asynchronous mode, the value of this property is recalculated every time this property is accessed, providing that the Frequency has elapsed since the previous access.  If the Frequency has not elapsed, then the previously calculated result is returned from a cache.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Message</h1>
					<h2>Message( Assigns new_value As String )</h2>
					<h2>Message( search_harder_for_result As Boolean = True ) As String</h2>
					<p>A textual message describing the process that is currently using the ProgressDelegateKFS object.</p>
					<p>If search_harder_for_result is True, then a non-empty string is searched for.  The search starts with the current node, and then does a breadth-first search of all the children.  The search ends when a non-empty string is found.  If no non-empty string exists in the entire tree, then an empty string is returned.</p>
					<p>When in Synchronous mode, the value of this property is cached, and accessing this property only involves returning the cache.</p>
					<p>When in Asynchronous mode, the value of this property is recalculated every time this property is accessed, providing that the Frequency has elapsed since the previous access.  If the Frequency has not elapsed, then the previously calculated result is returned from a cache.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Mode</h1>
					<h2>Mode() As Modes</h2>
					<h2>Mode( Assigns new_value As Modes )</h2>
					<p>The mode that the ProgressDelegateKFS object is currently operating in.  Can be any of the items in the Modes enumeration.</p>
					<p>The default mode for new ProgressDelegateKFS objects is FullSynchronous.  A new ProgressDelegateKFS object that is a child inherits its mode from its parent, except in the case when the parent is in InternalAsynchronous mode, in which case the default mode is ExternalAsynchronous.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Parent</h1>
					<h2>Parent() As ProgressDelegateKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a reference to the parent of the object, assuming that there is currently a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects.  Returns Nil if no parent exists.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldAutoUpdateObject</h1>
					<h2>ShouldAutoUpdateObject( obj As Object ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldAutoUpdateObject( obj As Object, Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given object should be automatically updated to reflect the properties of this ProgressDelegateKFS object.</p>
					<p>Currently, only ProgressBars and Labels are supported.  A ProgressBar will get its value updated according to the Value property, and its maximum updated according to the IndeterminateValue property.  A Label will get its caption updated according to the Message property.</p>
					<p>Registering an unsupported object for automatic updates does not result in any error or malfunction.  The object simply never gets updated.</p>
					<p>When an object is registered, it is updated immediately.  The object will then remain up-to-date automatically according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback</h1>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback( d As MessageEventMethod ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback( d As MessageEventMethod, Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given method should be invoked when the message changes.</p>
					<p>When a method is registered, it is invoked immediately.  The object will then be invoked subsequently according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldInvokeSignalChangedCallback</h1>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeSignalChangedCallback( d As SignalEventMethod ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeSignalChangedCallback( d As SignalEventMethod, Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given method should be invoked when the signal changes.</p>
					<p>When a method is registered, it is invoked immediately.  The object will then be invoked subsequently according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback</h1>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback( d As ValueEventMethod ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback( d As ValueEventMethod, Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given method should be invoked when the value changes.</p>
					<p>When a method is registered, it is invoked immediately.  The object will then be invoked subsequently according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigCancel</h1>
					<h2>SigCancel() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigCancel( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigCancel is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigKill</h1>
					<h2>SigKill() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigKill( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigKill is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Signal</h1>
					<h2>Signal() As Signals</h2>
					<h2>Signal( Assigns new_value As Signals )</h2>
					<p>The currently active signal.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive the new signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigNormal</h1>
					<h2>SigNormal() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigNormal( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigNormal is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
					<p>Setting SigNormal to False currently does nothing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigPause</h1>
					<h2>SigPause() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigPause( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigPause is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>TotalWeightOfChildren</h1>
					<h2>TotalWeightOfChildren() As Double</h2>
					<h2>TotalWeightOfChildren( Assigns new_value As Double )</h2>
					<p>The sum of all the weights of all the children.  Default value is zero.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this property is to allow for a way to get the overall value to slide gracefully from zero to one even when not all the children exist at the same time.  If all the children were created in parallel at the same time, then this property is not necessary.  Just add up the weights and do some math.  But, if not all of the children have been created yet, or if some of the children have already been deallocated, then some of the information for calculating the weights is missing.  With this property, you can tell a ProgressDelegateKFS object the total weight of all the children (if you know it), such that the relative weights of the existing children can be correctly handled.</p>
					<p>When the weight of a ProgressDelegateKFS object is set (and when the object is first created), the TotalWeightOfChildren property of its parent is automatically updated to make sure it is at least the total weight of the current children.  This allows for you, as the user of this class, to not need to care about this property when the children are operating in parallel rather than in series.  This property only exists for when the children are operating in series.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Value</h1>
					<h2>Value( Assigns new_value As Double )</h2>
					<h2>Value( include_children As Boolean = True ) As Double</h2>
					<p>The current value of this object.  Can optionally include the children, according to the relative weights.  Possible values range from 0 to 1.  Setting this value also sets IndeterminateValue to False.</p>
					<p>When in Synchronous mode, the value of this property is cached, and accessing this property only involves returning the cache.</p>
					<p>When in Asynchronous mode, the value of this property is recalculated every time this property is accessed, providing that the Frequency has elapsed since the previous access.  If the Frequency has not elapsed, then the previously calculated result is returned from a cache.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Weight</h1>
					<h2>Weight() As Double</h2>
					<h2>Weight( Assigns new_value As Double )</h2>
					<p>The weight of just this object.  Only used by a parent object, if one exists.  Allows for one child to be "worth" more than another.</p>
					<p>When this property is set, the TotalWeightOfChildren property of the parent node is updated to make sure that it is at least the total weight of the current children.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Flush</h1>
					<h2>Flush( ignore_throttle As Boolean = False, update_cache As Boolean = False )</h2>
					<p>Manually invokes an update that propagates down the tree, calling MessageChanged and ValueChanged events as it goes.  Optionally, this operation can ignore the throttle (when in ThrottledSynchronous mode), or it can update the cache.</p>
					<p>When in Asynchronous mode, the cache is always updated.  When in Synchronous mode, updating the cache is useless, since the cache is already up-to-date.  The update_cache parameter exists in the rare case when the current node is in Synchronous mode, but it has Asynchronous children.</p>
					<p>Part of the purpose of Flush is to force new data down the tree, ignoring the mode of each node as it goes.  If ignore_throttle is False, then Flush treats all nodes as ThrottledSynchronous.  If ignore_throttle is True, then Flush treats all nodes as FullSynchronous.</p>
					<p>If ignore_throttle is False and the flush encounters a node in ThrottledSynchronous mode with an unexpired throttle, the flush stops there.  If ignore_diff is False and the flush encounters a node where the data suggests that the value has not changed, then the flush stops there.</p>
					<p>Because Flush cannot fully respect Mode property, it is not optimal for normal use.  This method was initially created for debugging purposes.  There is nothing stopping a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects from becoming large and complex, with many branches and mixed modes.  If progress updates are not making it to the root node for some reason, it is useful to have a way to temporarily force progress updates down the tree with a single command, to help narrow down where the problem may be.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SpawnChild</h1>
					<h2>SpawnChild( new_weight As Double = 1, new_value As Double = 0, new_msg As String = "" ) As ProgressDelegateKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a ProgressDelegateKFS object that is a child of the current object.  The child's value is automatically incorporated into the parent's Value property, according to the weight of the child.  When the child deallocates, the entire relative weight of the child is automatically added to the parent, regardless of the child's value.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Shared Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SetMessage</h1>
					<h2>SetMessage( pgd As ProgressDelegateKFS, msg As String )</h2>
					<p>Sets the message of the given ProgressDelegateKFS object.  If the object is Nil, then no action is taken.  Comes in handy in complex algorithms, where one more If statement makes things more cluttered.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SetValue</h1>
					<h2>SetValue( pgd As ProgressDelegateKFS, v As Double )</h2>
					<p>Sets the value of the given ProgressDelegateKFS object.  If the object is Nil, then no action is taken.  Comes in handy in complex algorithms, where one more If statement makes things more cluttered.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is thread safe.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In general, this class is used to report the progress of a process that is made up of many pieces.  It still works in simpler situations, but it might be overkill.</p>
				<p>The previous version of this class was implemented using a simple stack.  This was much simpler, however it did not support reporting progress from more than one subprocess at a time.  Since the current version is implemented as a tree, a fully distributed process can seamlessly report progress to a single ProgressBar.</p>
				<p>This class supports automatically updating a ProgressBar object or a Label object.  If you would like more custom functionality, this class supports registering callbacks when the current value or message changes.  Or, if you would prefer the simple way, you can have a ProgressDelegateKFS object on a Window, and in the ValueChanged and MessageChanged events, update the controls on your window.</p>
				<p>The simple case of using this class is as follows.  Place a ProgressDelegateKFS object on a window, right next to your ProgressBar and Label for displaying progress.  In the Open event of the ProgressDelegateKFS object, add the ProgressBar and the label as automatically updated objects.  When you run your process, give it a reference to the ProgressDelegateKFS object on the Window.  As the process runs, it should set the message and the value of its local ProgressDelegateKFS object.  After that, it all just works.</p>

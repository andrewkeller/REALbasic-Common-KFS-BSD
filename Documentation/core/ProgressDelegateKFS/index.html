			<h2>ProgressDelegateKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>This class allows multiple distinct distributed processes to report progress such that a single ProgressBar can be smoothly updated without any of the processes needing to know about each other.</p>
			<p>The basic idea is that you give a reference to a ProgressDelegateKFS that you've configured to update a ProgressBar to one of your processes.  Then, that process spawns a ProgressDelegateKFS child for every one of its subprocesses.  Then, the ProgressDelegateKFS class does the math for you to figure how far along your process is overall.  This technique creates a tree of distinct ProgressDelegateKFS objects, each of which is feeding information to the root, which updates your ProgressBar.</p>
			<p>Although this class was primarily designed for convenience and data organization, it was also designed with efficiency in mind.  However, in true high performance computing, keep in mind that the fastest approach is always to manually throttle how often progress is reported.  This is true for all languages and all progress reporting mechanisms.</p>
			
			<h2>Delegates</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>BasicEventMethod</h1>
					<h2>BasicEventMethod( pgd As ProgressDelegateKFS )</h2>
					<p>The signature of callbacks and events used in this class.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Enumerations</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Signals</h1>
					<h2>Signals As Integer</h2>
					<p>Defines each possible signal supported by the ProgressDelegateKFS class.  Values include:
						<ul>
							<li>Normal</li>
							<li>Pause</li>
							<li>Cancel</li>
							<li>Kill</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Signals do not "do" anything by themselves.  The intention of signals is to allow the user interface (or any node N in a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects) to send a message to the working processes (or all the children of node N).</p>
					<p>A working process can check for signals by either polling or by providing a callback to its local ProgressDelegateKFS object (or both).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Events</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>MessageChanged</h1>
					<h2>MessageChanged()</h2>
					<p>Invoked when the value of Message(True) changes.</p>
					<p>This event is only raised at the root of a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects.  For children, this event is never raised.  To get a child to do something when its message changes, see the ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ValueChanged</h1>
					<h2>ValueChanged()</h2>
					<p>Invoked when the value of Value(True) or Indeterminate(True) changes.</p>
					<p>This event is only raised at the root of a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects.  For children, this event is never raised.  To get a child to do something when its value changes, see the ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback property.</p>

			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>ChildCount</h1>
					<h2>ChildCount() As Integer</h2>
					<p>Returns the number of ProgressDelegateKFS objects that are first children of this object.  This does not include past children which have been deallocated and no longer exist.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Children</h1>
					<h2>Children() As ProgressDelegateKFS()</h2>
					<p>Returns an array of the ProgressDelegateKFS objects that are first children of this object.  This does not include past children which have been deallocated and no longer exist.</p>
					<p>The order of the array is currently undefined, although it usually corresponds with the order that the children were added.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Frequency</h1>
					<h2>Frequency() As DurationKFS</h2>
					<h2>Frequency( Assigns new_value As DurationKFS )</h2>
					<p>The amount of time that must pass before any notifications are provided again.  Notifications include the ValueChanged and MessageChanged events, callbacks, and auto-updated objects.</p>
					<p>The object returned by this property is completely sanitized and decoupled from this class.  Changing its value does not change the value that this class will use for the Frequency.  To change the frequency, you must set the Frequency equal to an alternate DurationKFS object.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>IndeterminateValue</h1>
					<h2>IndeterminateValue( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<h2>IndeterminateValue( include_children As Boolean = True ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not progress cannot be determined.  Metaphorically equivalent to a ProgressBar object with the Maximum set to zero.  Default value is True.  Becomes False automatically if the Value property is set in any way, including via a child deallocating and incrementing the value of its parent.</p>
					<p>If include_children is True, then the children are searched for any node (including Me) that has an IndeterminateValue of False.  If any exist, then result of this property is False.  If none exist, then this property is True.</p>
					<p>When getting this value, the value is recalculated only when the value has changed.  In multiple rapid successions of getting, it is likely that the value will only be recalculated once.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Message</h1>
					<h2>Message( Assigns new_value As String )</h2>
					<h2>Message( include_children As Boolean = True ) As String</h2>
					<p>A textual message describing the process that is currently using the ProgressDelegateKFS object.</p>
					<p>If include_children is True, then a non-empty string is searched for.  The search starts with the current node, and then does a breadth-first search of all the children.  The search ends when a non-empty string is found.  If no non-empty string exists in the entire tree, then an empty string is returned.</p>
					<p>When getting this value, the value is recalculated only when the value has changed.  In multiple rapid successions of getting, it is likely that the value will only be recalculated once.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Parent</h1>
					<h2>Parent() As ProgressDelegateKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a reference to the parent of the object, assuming that there is currently a tree of ProgressDelegateKFS objects.  Returns Nil if no parent exists.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldAutoUpdateObject</h1>
					<h2>ShouldAutoUpdateObject( obj As Object ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldAutoUpdateObject( obj As Object, Assigns should_update As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given object should be automatically updated to reflect the properties of this ProgressDelegateKFS object.</p>
					<p>Currently, only ProgressBars and Labels are supported.  A ProgressBar will get its value updated according to the Value property, and its maximum updated according to the IndeterminateValue property.  A Label will get its caption updated according to the Message property.</p>
					<p>Registering an unsupported object for automatic updates does not result in any error or malfunction.  The object simply never gets updated.</p>
					<p>When an object is registered, it is updated immediately.  The object will then remain up-to-date automatically according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback</h1>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback( d As MessageEventMethod ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeMessageChangedCallback( d As MessageEventMethod, Assigns should_update As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given method should be invoked when the message changes.</p>
					<p>When a method is registered, it is invoked immediately.  The object will then be invoked subsequently according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback</h1>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback( d As ValueEventMethod ) As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>ShouldInvokeValueChangedCallback( d As ValueEventMethod, Assigns should_update As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Sets or tells whether or not the given method should be invoked when the value changes.</p>
					<p>When a method is registered, it is invoked immediately.  The object will then be invoked subsequently according to the current mode.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigCancel</h1>
					<h2>SigCancel() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigCancel( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigCancel is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigKill</h1>
					<h2>SigKill() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigKill( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigKill is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Signal</h1>
					<h2>Signal() As Signals</h2>
					<h2>Signal( Assigns new_value As Signals )</h2>
					<p>The currently active signal.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive the new signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigNormal</h1>
					<h2>SigNormal() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigNormal( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigNormal is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
					<p>Setting SigNormal to False currently does nothing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SigPause</h1>
					<h2>SigPause() As Boolean</h2>
					<h2>SigPause( Assigns new_value As Boolean )</h2>
					<p>Represents whether or not SigPause is currently set.</p>
					<p>When setting, all of the children also receive this signal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>TotalWeightOfChildren</h1>
					<h2>TotalWeightOfChildren() As Double</h2>
					<h2>TotalWeightOfChildren( Assigns new_value As Double )</h2>
					<p>The sum of all the weights of all the children.  Default value is zero.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this property is to allow for a way to get the overall value to slide gracefully from zero to one even when not all the children exist at the same time.  If all the children were created in parallel at the same time, then this property is not necessary.  Just add up the weights and do some math.  But, if not all of the children have been created yet, or if some of the children have already been deallocated, then some of the information for calculating the weights is missing.  With this property, you can tell a ProgressDelegateKFS object the total weight of all the children (if you know it), such that the relative weights of the existing children can be correctly handled.</p>
					<p>When the weight of a ProgressDelegateKFS object is set (and when the object is first created), the TotalWeightOfChildren property of its parent is automatically updated to make sure it is at least the total weight of the current children.  This allows for you, as the user of this class, to not need to care about this property when the children are operating in parallel rather than in series.  This property only exists for when the children are operating in series.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Value</h1>
					<h2>Value( Assigns new_value As Double )</h2>
					<h2>Value( include_children As Boolean = True ) As Double</h2>
					<p>The current value of this object.  Can optionally include the children, according to the relative weights.  Possible values range from 0 to 1.  Setting this value also sets IndeterminateValue to False.</p>
					<p>When getting this value, the value is recalculated only when the value has changed.  In multiple rapid successions of getting, it is likely that the value will only be recalculated once.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Weight</h1>
					<h2>Weight() As Double</h2>
					<h2>Weight( Assigns new_value As Double )</h2>
					<p>The weight of just this object.  Only used by a parent object, if one exists.  Allows for one child to be "worth" more than another.</p>
					<p>When this property is set, the TotalWeightOfChildren property of the parent node is updated to make sure that it is at least the total weight of the current children.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SpawnChild</h1>
					<h2>SpawnChild( new_weight As Double = 1, new_value As Double = 0, new_message As String = "" ) As ProgressDelegateKFS</h2>
					<p>Returns a ProgressDelegateKFS object that is a child of the current object.  The child's value is automatically incorporated into the parent's Value property, according to the weight of the child.  When the child deallocates, the entire relative weight of the child is automatically added to the parent, regardless of the child's value.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Shared Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SetMessage</h1>
					<h2>SetMessage( pgd As ProgressDelegateKFS, new_message As String )</h2>
					<p>Sets the message of the given ProgressDelegateKFS object.  If the object is Nil, then no action is taken.  Comes in handy in complex algorithms, where one more If statement makes things more cluttered.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>SetValue</h1>
					<h2>SetValue( pgd As ProgressDelegateKFS, new_value As Double )</h2>
					<p>Sets the value of the given ProgressDelegateKFS object.  If the object is Nil, then no action is taken.  Comes in handy in complex algorithms, where one more If statement makes things more cluttered.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is thread safe.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>In general, this class is used to report the progress of a process that is made up of many pieces.  It still works in simpler situations, but it might be overkill.</p>
				<p>The previous version of this class was implemented using a simple stack.  This was much simpler, however it did not support reporting progress from more than one subprocess at a time.  Since the current version is implemented as a tree, a fully distributed process can seamlessly report progress to a single ProgressBar.</p>
				<p>This class supports automatically updating a ProgressBar object or a Label object.  If you would like more custom functionality, this class supports registering callbacks when the current value or message changes.  Or, if you would prefer the simple way, you can have a ProgressDelegateKFS object on a Window, and in the ValueChanged and MessageChanged events, update the controls on your window.</p>
				<p>The simple case of using this class is as follows.  Place a ProgressDelegateKFS object on a window, right next to your ProgressBar and Label for displaying progress.  In the Open event of the ProgressDelegateKFS object, add the ProgressBar and the label as automatically updated objects.  When you run your process, give it a reference to the ProgressDelegateKFS object on the Window.  As the process runs, it should set the message and the value of its local ProgressDelegateKFS object.  After that, it all just works.</p>

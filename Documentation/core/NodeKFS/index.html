			<h2>NodeKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>This class is designed to be a generic node class, used for creating more sophisticated data structures.</p>
			<p>This class looks so bland because adding more features typically makes things less generic.</p>
			
			<h2>Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>[default]</h1>
					<h2>New NodeKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new NodeKFS object with Nil for all the properties.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Left</h1>
					<h2>Left As NodeKFS</h2>
					<p>One of the two available children properties.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Parent</h1>
					<h2>Parent As NodeKFS</h2>
					<p>The parent node.  This property is implemented using a WeakRef.  This property never throws an exception.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Right</h1>
					<h2>Right As NodeKFS</h2>
					<p>The other of the two available children properties.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Value</h1>
					<h2>Value As Variant</h2>
					<p>The payload.</p>
				</div>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>When creating any data structure more advanced than a singly-linked list, you must be concerned with accidentally creating a reference loop.  Since REALbasic uses reference counting to know when to deallocate objects, it stands to reason that a set of objects, each with a reference to another in a loop, none of the objects will ever have a reference count of zero, and thus, will never be deallocated.  To solve this problem, WeakRefs can be used.  A WeakRef contains a reference to an object without counting for that object's reference count.</p>
				<p>If you are creating a singly-linked list, then use the Right property to link to the next node.</p>
				<p>If you are creating a doubly-linked list, then use the Right and Parent properties to link to the next and previous nodes (respectively).</p>
				<p>If you are creating a doubly-linked binary tree, then use the Right and Left properties for linking to the children, and the Parent property for linking to the parent.</p>
				<p>In other words, the Parent property is special.  Since it is implemented using a WeakRef, it does not count as one of the references to that object.  Use the Parent property only, and always, when appropriate.</p>

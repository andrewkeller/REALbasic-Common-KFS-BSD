			<h2>UnitTestExceptionKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from RuntimeException)</span></h2>
			<p>The UnitTestExceptionKFS method represents a problem with a test case.  It could either be a failed assertion, such as "Expected True but found False", or it can be an uncaught exception such as "An unhandled IOException was raised sometime before assertion number 4".</p>
			
			<h2>Shared Methods Used as Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>NewExceptionFromAssertionFailure</h1>
					<h2>NewExceptionFromAssertionFailure( testClass As UnitTestBaseClassKFS, failure As String, msg As String = "" ) As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<h2>NewExceptionFromAssertionFailure( testClass As UnitTestBaseClassKFS, expectedValue As Variant, foundValue As Variant, msg As String = "" ) As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new UnitTestExceptionKFS that represents the given assertion failure.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>NewExceptionFromException</h1>
					<h2>NewExceptionFromException( testClass As UnitTestBaseClassKFS, e As RuntimeException, msg As String = "" ) As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new UnitTestExceptionKFS that represents the given exception, assuming it was caught.  This makes the exception look more like a failed assertion and less like an uncaught exception.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>NewExceptionFromUncaughtException</h1>
					<h2>NewExceptionFromUncaughtException( testClass As UnitTestBaseClassKFS, e As RuntimeException, msg As String = "" ) As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new UnitTestExceptionKFS that represents the given exception, assuming is was not caught.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>AssertionNumber</h1>
					<h2>AssertionNumber() As Integer</h2>
					<p>Returns the assertion number of the failed assertion, or the assertion number that the exception occurred before.  Check the IsAFailedAssertion property to tell which is which.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>ExceptionWasCaught</h1>
					<h2>ExceptionWasCaught() As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Returns whether or not the exception was caught.  Returns False if this is an assertion failure and no exception was involved.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>FailureMessage</h1>
					<h2>FailureMessage() As String</h2>
					<p>Returns the technical reason behind the problem, for example, "Expected 4 but found 2."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>IsAFailedAssertion</h1>
					<h2>IsAFailedAssertion() As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Returns whether or not this exception represents a failed assertion.  True means it's an assertion failure, and False means there is another exception involved.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Message</h1>
					<h2>Message() As String</h2>
					<p>Returns an explanation of this error.  Includes all available data except the stack trace.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>SituationalMessage</h1>
					<h2>SituationalMessage() As String</h2>
					<p>Returns the textual message at the time of the assertion or exception.  Includes the entire message stack.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Stack</h1>
					<h2>Stack() As String()</h2>
					<p>Returns the textual message at the time of the assertion or exception.  Includes the entire message stack.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is thread safe.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>When using this class, don't forget that a UnitTestExceptionKFS represents a generic problem.  It might be an assertion failure, or it might not.  It might be an exception, or it might not.  It might be an uncaught exception, or it might not.  Don't assume what kind of problem a UnitTestExceptionKFS represents.</p>

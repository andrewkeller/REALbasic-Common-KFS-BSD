			<h2>UnitTestBaseClassKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>The UnitTestBaseClassKFS class is what all test classes must be subclasses of.  It provides the Assertion methods, and provides setup and tear down events for your test cases.  The UnitTestArbiterKFS class can only execute tests in a UnitTestBaseClassKFS subclass.</p>
			
			<h2>Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>[default]</h1>
					<h2>New UnitTestBaseClassKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new UnitTestBaseClassKFS object.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Events</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>AfterTestCase</h1>
					<h2>AfterTestCase( testMethodName As String )</h2>
					<p>Raised at the conclusion of every test case, regardless of whether or not the setup, core, or verify stages failed previously.  Used for cleaning up any junk that a test case may have accumulated.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>BeforeTestCase</h1>
					<h2>BeforeTestCase( testMethodName As String )</h2>
					<p>Raised before every test case.  Used for initializing any one-time-use resources your test cases need to run.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ConstructorWithAssertionHandling</h1>
					<h2>ConstructorWithAssertionHandling()</h2>
					<p>Raised before the first test case is ran.  Used for initializing any reusable resources your test cases need to run.  If an assertion fails in this event, then all the test cases in the class will be skipped.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Destructor</h1>
					<h2>Destructor()</h2>
					<p>Raised right before the test class is unloaded from memory.  Used as a last chance to clean up any junk your test cases may have accumulated.  If an assertion fails, then it is not recorded.  All other exceptions are not caught, and are able to take down your app if you don't catch them yourself.  This event is not the place for testing code.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>MethodIsATestMethod</h1>
					<h2>MethodIsATestMethod( methodName As String, ByRef isATestMethod As Boolean ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Provides a way to customize the naming convention for the test cases in the test class.  Called for each method that could be a test method.  A test method must have no parameters and return nothing, and its name must not be one already used for something else in the UnitTestBaseClassKFS class.</p>
					<p>The default value of the isATestMethod parameter when this event is raised is equal to whether or not the default naming convention considers the given method method a test case.  Regardless of the value of isATestMethod, return True from this event to declare that you endorse its value, or return False to cause the UnitTestBaseClassKFS class use the default naming convention to decide whether or not the current method is a test case.  Having no code in this event has the effect of returning False.</p>
					<p>The default naming convention for test cases is any plain method with a name beginning with "Test".</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>VerifyTestCase</h1>
					<h2>VerifyTestCase( testMethodName As String )</h2>
					<p>Raised after the core and before the teardown stages of a test case.  Unlike the AfterTestCase event, this event is only ran once the core stage gets a status of Passed.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			
			<p>Note: In the following Assertion definitions, the following applies.</p>
			<p>The idea of an assertion being terminal or not refers to whether or not the assertion is critical to the correctness of the test case.  If failing the assertion makes the rest of the test case unstable or even pointless, then the assertion should be terminal.  If failing the assertion does not affect the stability of the test case, and additional failures would be helpful, then make the assertion nonterminal, and your test will continue on even on a failure.  All failed assertions are logged, whether they shoot down your test case or not.</p>
			<p>A Presumption is the same as a nonterminal Assertion, except that a Presumption also returns whether or not the assertion passed (Boolean).  This is useful for when the outcome of an assertion can affect the stability and/or relevance of some subsequent assertions, but not necessarily the entire rest of the test case.  A Presumption is typically used as an argument to an If statement.  The end of the If statement would then mark the end of the assertions dependent on the success of the Presumption.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>AssertionCount</h1>
					<h2>AssertionCount() As Integer</h2>
					<p>Tells how many assertions have been made.  The assertion methods increment this variable before they test the criteria.  The value of this property is used when describing the location of failed assertions.</p>
					<p>This property is visible so that you can create your own assertions for a particular test class, and have the opportunity to update the assertion count so that it is correct.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ClassName</h1>
					<h2>ClassName() As String</h2>
					<p>Returns the name of the class.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Lock</h1>
					<h2>Lock() As CriticalSection</h2>
					<p>Used by the UnitTestArbiterKFS class to ensure that only one test case is ran at a time in a test class.  Do not touch this property unless you are implementing your own arbiter, or if you are in some way running a test case yourself.  In that case, you should enter the lock before you start doing something, and leave the lock after you are done.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is inherently single threaded, but a locking mechanism (see the Lock property) is used to make this class thread safe.  Multiple arbiter threads, or even multiple arbiters, can all be instructed to run the test cases in this class, and they will each wait for their turn.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>To create your own test cases, you must first start with a test class.  A test class is a subclass of the UnitTestBaseClassKFS class, which provides the Assertion methods.  It does not matter what you call the class, but typically, the name of the test class should hint as to what it tests.  If you have written a class called Foo, then a good name for a corresponding test class is TestFoo:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Class TestFoo</p>
					<p>Inherits UnitTestBaseClassKFS</p>
					<p>End Class</p>
				</div>
				<p>Then, you must add test cases.  A test case is a method with a name that begins with Test, and lives inside a test class.  Suppose my class Foo has a length property that is equal to the length of a string that you pass to its constructor.  I would write a test case to make sure the Length property works like this:<p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Class TestFoo</p>
					<p>Inherits UnitTestBaseClassKFS</p>
					<div class="codeblock">
						<br />
						<p>Sub TestLength()</p>
						<div class="codeblock">
							<br />
							<p>// Makes sure the Length property of the class Foo works properly.</p>
							<br />
							<p>Dim f As New Foo( "Hello, World!" )</p>
							<p>AssertEquals 13, f.Length, "The Length property didn't work with the standard case."</p>
							<br />
							<p>f = New Foo( "foobar" )</p>
							<p>AssertEquals 6, f.Length, "The Length property didn't work with the other standard case."</p>
							<br />
							<p>f = New Foo( "" )</p>
							<p>AssertEquals 0, f.Length, "The Length property didn't work with the zero case."</p>
							<br />
						</div>
						<p>End Sub</p>
					</div>
					<br />
					<p>End Class</p>
				</div>
				<p>Alternatively, if you would like a more elegant approach to the failure messages, then you can take advantage of the message stack.  The message stack allows you to to not be as specific as normal in the failure messages for each assertion, and instead rely on a more piecewise, hierarchal approach.  It is useful when you have a sequence of failure messages that seem to repeat.  The above code would translate into the following code:<p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Class TestFoo</p>
					<p>Inherits UnitTestBaseClassKFS</p>
					<div class="codeblock">
						<br />
						<p>Sub TestAbstractFile_AbstractPath()</p>
						<div class="codeblock">
							<p>// Makes sure the Length property of the class Foo works properly.</p>
							<br />
							<p class="ofinterest">PushMessageStack "The Length property didn't work with "</p>
							<br />
							<p>Dim f As New Foo( "Hello, World!" )</p>
							<p>AssertEquals 13, f.Length, "the standard case."</p>
							<br />
							<p>f = New Foo( "foobar" )</p>
							<p>AssertEquals 6, f.Length, "the other standard case."</p>
							<br />
							<p>f = New Foo( "" )</p>
							<p>AssertEquals 0, f.Length, "the zero case."</p>
							<br />
							<p class="ofinterest">PopMessageStack</p>
							<br />
						</div>
						<p>End Sub</p>
					</div>
					<br />
					<p>End Class</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Discussion on Stashing Exceptions</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Normally, when an assertion fails, the validity of your test case becomes compromised, and it makes sense to let the assertion failure kill your test case right there.  This is how assertions normally work.</p>
				<p>Sometimes, however, a sequence of assertions in a test may be completely unrelated, and the failure of one of them does not affect the validity of the other assertions.  In this case, sometimes it is beneficial to keep running the test case, and get more failure messages.</p>
				<p>There are four basic ways to control how an assertion affects the progression of your test case.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You can cause assertions to take down your test case in the event of a failure.  Do this by passing True, or nothing at all, to the last parameter (isTerminal) of an Assertion statement.  This is the default.</li>
					<li>You can pass False to the last parameter of an Assertion statement.  This causes the assertion to be nonterminal, which means that if it fails, the exception will be stashed, rather than allowed to take down your test case.</li>
					<li>You can use Presumption statements rather than Assertion statements.  Presumption statements exclusively stash exceptions, and return whether or not a failure occurred and was stashed.  Presumption statements are commonly used as a parameter to an If statement.  This allows you to control whether or not a block of code executes based on the result of a Presumption.</li>
					<li>You can use normal terminal Assertions, and catch any failures in an enclosing Try block.  When an exception is caught, use the StashException method to add the exception to the stash.  The StashExecption method accepts any type of exception; it does not have to be an assertion failure.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>These four approaches roughly translate to the following scenarios:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In a sequence of assertion statements, any one of them failing will take down the whole test case.</li>
					<li>In a sequence of assertion statements, a failure will not cause any change in the flow or progression of the test case.</li>
					<li>A defined sequence of assertion statements can be skipped if a preceding Presumption statement fails.</li>
					<li>In a defined sequence of assertion statements, a failure will cause the remaining assertions in the Try block to be skipped.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Stashing exceptions is a neat little feature, but it can be easily misused.  If an assertion is critical to the validity of the test case and you don't let it take down your test case, then you should be careful about any subsequent exceptions.  They may be moot or even incorrect if the validity of your test case has been compromised.</p>

			<h2>UnitTestResultKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>The UnitTestResultKFS class is used by the UnitTestArbiterKFS class to represent the results of a single test case.  It contains all the exceptions that were thrown, and how much time it took the test to run.</p>
			
			<h2>Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>UnitTestBaseClassKFS, Introspection.MethodInfo, Boolean = True</h1>
					<h2>New UnitTestBaseClassKFS( subject As UnitTestBaseClassKFS, topic As Introspection.MethodInfo, doRunTheTest As Boolean = True )</h2>
					<p>Creates a new UnitTestResultKFS object that runs, and then represents, the results for the given unit test.</p>
					<p>The Boolean parameter is how a skipped test is created.  If something basic about the test class fails, then you might not want to run the rest of the test cases.  In that case, however, you still want to have result containers for the skipped tests.  Solution?  A test can be skipped.</p>
				</div>

			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>e_ClassSetup()</h1>
					<h2>e_ClassSetup() As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>An array of the exceptions raised during the execution of the test class' constructor.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>e_Core()</h1>
					<h2>e_Core() As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>An array of the exceptions raised during the execution of the test case.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>e_Setup()</h1>
					<h2>e_Setup() As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>An array of the exceptions raised during the execution of the test case setup event.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>e_TearDown()</h1>
					<h2>e_TearDown() As UnitTestExceptionKFS</h2>
					<p>An array of the exceptions raised during the execution of the test case tear down event.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>TestCaseFailed</h1>
					<h2>TestCaseFailed As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not this test case is considered failed, based on whether or not there are any exceptions.  A failed test class constructor currently causes the test case to appear as failed.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>TestCasePassed</h1>
					<h2>TestCasePassed As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not this test case is considered passed, based on whether or not there are any exceptions.  If a test case did not pass, then do not assume it is a failure; check whether or not the test case was skipped.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>TestCaseSkipped</h1>
					<h2>TestCaseSkipped As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not this test case was skipped.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>TestClassName</h1>
					<h2>TestClassName As String</h2>
					<p>Tells the name of the test class.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>TestMethodName</h1>
					<h2>TestMethodName As String</h2>
					<p>Tells the name of the test case.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>t_ClassSetup</h1>
					<h2>t_ClassSetup As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>Tells the time it took for the test class constructor to run.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>t_Core</h1>
					<h2>t_Core As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>Tells the time it took for the core segment of the test case to run.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>t_Setup</h1>
					<h2>t_Setup As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>Tells the time it took for the setup event to run for this test case.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>t_TearDown</h1>
					<h2>t_TearDown As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>Tells the time it took for the tear down event to run for this test case.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is thread safe.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Not all of the properties are are provided as read-only, like they perhaps should be.  Try to avoid modifying the contents of a UnitTestResultKFS object after it has been created.</p>

			<h2>DurationKFS <span class=cd>(Inherits from Object)</span></h2>
			<p>This class represents a duration, such that you never have to care about the units.  It also has a built-in stopwatch, so you don't have to keep track of the units of an external timing device.</p>
			<p>The actual value of time is stored as microseconds in a UInt64 variable.  This means that the minimum value of a DurationKFS object is 0, and the maximum value is 5,845 centuries, also known as 213,503,982 days, or 18,446,744,073,709 seconds, all with an accuracy of microseconds.</p>

			<h2>Convert Constructors</h2>
			<div class="convgraph">
				<div class="in">
					<h1>Double</h1>
					<h1>Timer</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="center"><p>DurationKFS</p></div>
				<div class="out">
					<h1>Double</h1>
				</div>
				<p>When converting to or from a Double, units are assumed to be seconds.  When converting from a Timer, the Timer's Period property is inherited.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>IntegerValue</h1>
					<h2>IntegerValue( powerOfTen As Double = 0 ) As UInt64</h2>
					<h2>IntegerValue( powerOfTen As Double = 0, Assigns newValue As UInt64 )</h2>
					<p>Gets or sets the current value as a UInt64.  The argument is the units.  See the constants for available units.  This property can get or set any possible integer value of a DurationKFS object.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>MicrosecondsValue</h1>
					<h2>MicrosecondsValue() As UInt64</h2>
					<h2>MicrosecondsValue( Assigns newValue As UInt64 )</h2>
					<p>Gets or sets the raw value stored as microseconds in the object.  Logically the same as IntegerValue( DurationKFS.kMicroseconds ).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Value</h1>
					<h2>Value( powerOfTen As Double = 0 ) As Double</h2>
					<h2>Value( powerOfTen As Double = 0, Assigns newValue As Double )</h2>
					<p>Gets or sets the current value as a Double.  The argument is the units.  See the constants for available units.</p>
					<p>Doubles can only report values up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.  Since a DurationKFS object can hold a value up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 microseconds (5,845 centuries), reporting such a large value would cause truncation of the value, making it lower that the original UInt64 value.  If you are converting to a larger unit of time, such as seconds or days, then you would be able to get the first 17 or so digits (regardless of where the decimal place is), but the remaining digits would be lower than the actual value.</p>
					<p>In other words, getting and setting UInt64 values results in perfect accuracy, but with Doubles, beware of the lower ceiling value.  Any unit with a power of ten of -6 or lower (includes microseconds) will not be able to contain values higher than approximately 9.223E18.  In the other direction, any unit with a power of ten of -5 or higher (includes milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and up), will experience a general loss of precision.  Of course, the Value property has the advantage of being able to deal with decimal places at all, so it's a trade off.  For normal, low values, there shouldn't be much of a problem, except with maybe the last 1 or two significant digits.</p>

			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>CancelStopwatch</h1>
					<h2>CancelStopwatch()</h2>
					<p>Cancels the stopwatch, which returns its value to before you called Start.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Clear</h1>
					<h2>Clear()</h2>
					<p>Sets the value of the object to zero, and resets the stopwatch.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Split</h1>
					<h2>Split() As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>Stops the stopwatch, and returns a new DurationKFS object with the stopwatch running.  The stop time on the first DurationKFS object exactly equals the start time of the new DurationFKS object, so if you have a series of DurationKFS objects created using the Split method, then the sum of them will exactly equal the total elapsed time, accurate to microseconds.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Start</h1>
					<h2>Start()</h2>
					<p>Starts the stopwatch.  Any time you get the value of the object as long as the stopwatch is running, the value will continue to go up in real time.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Stop</h1>
					<h2>Stop()</h2>
					<p>Stops the stopwatch, and adds the time elapsed since you called Start to the value.  When you get the value of the object, the value will no longer appear to continue to go up.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Operator Overloading</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>+</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Add( other As DurationKFS ) As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>DurationKFS objects can be added together.  Upon an overflow, the result will equal the maximum possible value.</p>
					<h2>Operator_Add( other As Date ) As Date</h2>
					<h2>Operator_AddRight( other As Date ) As Date</h2>
					<p>A Date object and a DurationKFS object can be added together to form a new Date object sometime in the future.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;&gt;</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Compare(other As BigStringKFS) As Integer</h2>
					<p>When DurationFKS objects are compared, only their current values (including the stopwatch, if it is running) are taken into account.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>/</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Divide(other As BigStringKFS) As Double</h2>
					<p>You can get the ratio (Double) of one DurationKFS to another.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>\</h1>
					<h2>Operator_IntegerDivide(other As BigStringKFS) As UInt64</h2>
					<p>You can get the ratio (UInt64) of one DurationKFS to another.</p>

				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Mod</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Modulo(other As BigStringKFS) As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>You can get the remainder of time after subtracting as many as will fit of one DurationKFS from another.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>*</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Multiply(iScalar As Integer) As BigStringKFS</h2>
					<h2>Operator_MultiplyRight(iScalar As Integer) As BigStringKFS</h2>
					<p>A DurationKFS can be multiplied by a scalar.  Upon an overflow, the result will equal the maximum possible value.</p>

					<h1>-</h1>
					<h2>Operator_Subtract( other As DurationKFS ) As DurationKFS</h2>
					<p>You can subtract one DurationKFS from another.</p>
					<h2>Operator_SubtractRight( other As Date ) As Date</h2>
					<p>You can get a Date that is a certain DurationKFS before another Date.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is thread safe.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class makes keeping track of time easy.  For example, the following code times how long it takes MySampleMethod() to run:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Dim t As New DurationKFS</p>
					<p>t.Start</p>
					<br />
					<p>MySampleMethod()</p>
					<br />
					<p>t.Stop</p>
					<p>MsgBox "It took " + Format( t.Value( DurationKFS.kSeconds ), "0.0" ) + " seconds to run MySampleMethod."</p>

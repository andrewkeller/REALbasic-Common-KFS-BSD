			<h2>HierarchalDictionaryFunctionsKFS <span class=cd>(Module)</span></h2>
			<p>This module provides functions that can access and modify nested Dictionaries.</p>
			<p>This module is scheduled to replace the PropertyListKFS class, as soon as file I/O works.</p>
			
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>BinCount</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.BinCount( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Integer</h2>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.BinCount( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant, Assigns newBinCount As Integer )</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets the BinCount of the Dictionary located at the given series of keys.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Child</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Child( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Dictionary</h2>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Child( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant, Assigns newChild As Dictionary )</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets the Dictionary object at the given series of keys.  When getting a child, if the path does not point to a Dictionary, an InvalidPathException is raised.  Setting a child creates intermediary children as required, overwrites anything in the way, and never throws an exception.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Children</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Children( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Dictionary()</h2>
					<p>Returns the set of Dictionaries that are children of the Dictionary at the given path.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Count</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Count( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Integer</h2>
					<p>Returns the value of the Count property of the Dictionary located at the given series of keys.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>HasChild</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.HasChild( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Returns whether or not the given series of keys points to a Dictionary.  An exception is never thrown.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>HasKey</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.HasKey( pathRoot As Variant, pathNext As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Returns whether or not the given path points to anything.  An exception is never thrown.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Key</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Key( index As Integer, pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant</h2>
					<p>Returns the value of the key at the given index in the Dictionary located at the given series of keys.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Keys</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Keys( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant()</h2>
					<p>Returns the set of keys in the Dictionary located at the given series of keys.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Keys_Filtered</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Keys_Filtered( includeNonChildren As Boolean, includeChildren As Boolean, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant()</h2>
					<p>Returns the set of keys that conform to the given parameters in the Dictionary located at the given series of keys.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>NonChildren</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.NonChildren( ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant()</h2>
					<p>Returns the set of objects that are children of the Dictionary at the given path and are not Dictionaries.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Value</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Value( pathRoot As Variant, pathNext As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant</h2>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Value( pathRoot As Variant, pathNext As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant, Assigns newValue As Variant )</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets the value associated with the end of the given series of keys.  When getting a value, if the path does not point to anything, an InvalidPathException is raised. Setting a value creates intermediary children as required, overwrites anything in the way, and never throws an exception.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Values</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Values( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant()</h2>
					<p>Returns the set of objects that are children of the Dictionary at the given path.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Clear</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Clear( pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant )</h2>
					<p>Invokes the Clear method of the Dictionary class on the Dictionary located at the given series of keys.  If the path does not point to a Dictionary, then an InvalidPathException is raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Lookup_R</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Lookup_R( defaultValue As Variant, pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant</h2>
					<p>Returns the value at the given path, or returns the default value upon an error.  Never throws an exception.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Remove</h1>
					<h2><span class=cd>Dictionary</span>.Remove( cleanUp As Boolean, pathRoot As Variant, ParamArray path As Variant ) As Variant()</h2>
					<p>Unlinks the value located by the given series of keys.  Unlike the Dictionary's Remove method, this method will never throw an exception.  It is more of "make this path go away", and less of "remove this key".  If the cleanUp parameter is True, then this method will remove all empty non-root Dictionaries along the path.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>The functions in this module are compatible with console applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>The functions in this module are not currently thread safe.  Use appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure correct functionality.</p>

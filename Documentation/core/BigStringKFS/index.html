					<h2>NewString As BigStringKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new empty BigStringKFS instance.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>NewStringExpectingLargeContents</h1>
					<h2>NewStringExpectingLargeContents As BigStringKFS</h2>
					<p>Creates a new empty BigStringKFS instance that is rigged to store the string data in a swap file by default, rather than memory.</p>

			<h2>Convert Constructors</h2>
			<div class="convgraph">
				<div class="in">
					<h1>BinaryStream</h1>
					<h1>Folderitem</h1>
					<h1>MemoryBlock*</h1>
					<h1>String</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="center"><p>BigStringKFS</p></div>
				<div class="out">
					<h1>BinaryStream</h1>
					<h1>MemoryBlock*</h1>
					<h1>String</h1>
				</div>
				<p>* Conversions to and from the MemoryBlock class are available transitively through the String class.  Although it works just fine, it might not be as efficient as you would want in some situations.  For optimal efficiency, use the MemoryBlockValue property instead of the convert constructor to get or set a MemoryBlock.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>AbstractFilePath</h1>
					<h2>AbstractFilePath As String</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets an abstract path (a file path that doesn't exist) for this instance.  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>LastErrorCode</h1>
					<h2>LastErrorCode As Integer</h2>
					<p>Returns the last error code of this instance.  The values correspond with the kErrCode* constants.  Accessing all properties and methods in this class changes the value of LastErrorCode, except when stated otherwise.  This property is used in conjunction with the LastSystemErrorCode property, and contains more general information about errors.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>LastSystemErrorCode</h1>
					<h2>LastSystemErrorCode As Integer</h2>
					<p>Returns the last system error code of this instance.  The values correspond with system constants.  This property is used in conjunction with the LastErrorCode property, and contains more specific information about errors.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>FolderitemValue</h1>
					<h2>FolderitemValue( allowSwapAccess As Boolean = True ) As Folderitem</h2>
					<h2>FolderitemValue( Assigns newValue As Folderitem )</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets the current file being used to store the string data for this instance.  When getting the value, you can optionally allow access to an internal swap file.  Returns Nil if a file is not used for storing the string data.  Does not raise an IOException when dealing with an abstract file.  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
					<p>This property is relatively unique among the *Value properties in the sense that this property is less of "Export the string data as...", and is more of "The string data might or might not be here".  This property provides the current Folderitem being used to store the data; it does not export the data to a Folderitem.  Hence, this property is also unique in the sense that it will never throw an exception.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>GetDataSourceSummary</h1>
					<h2>GetDataSourceSummary As String</h2>
					<p>Returns a human readable string describing where the string data is stored.  Text is either a file path, or one of the kDataSource* constants.  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>Length</h1>
					<h2>Length As UInt64</h2>
					<p>Returns the length of the string data in this instance.  Raises an IOException when dealing with an abstract file.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>MemoryBlockValue</h1>
					<h2>MemoryBlockValue As MemoryBlock</h2>
					<p>Returns or sets the value of the string data in this instance as a MemoryBlock.  The result is always unlinked from the storage of this instance, except when you provided a MemoryBlock as the source of the data, in which case the same MemoryBlock object is returned.  Raises an IOException when dealing with an abstract file.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>StringDataCanBeAccessed</h1>
					<h2>StringDataCanBeAccessed As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not the string data in this instance can be accessed (a file might not exist, there might be an abstract file, etc).  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>StringDataInvolvesAbstractFile</h1>
					<h2>StringDataInvolvesAbstractFile As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not the string data in this instance is stored in an abstract file (a file that doesn't actually exist).  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>StringDataInvolvesBinaryStream</h1>
					<h2>StringDataInvolvesBinaryStream As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not the string data in this instance is stored in something on the other end of a BinaryStream.  This does not include data structures where the back end of the BinaryStream is accounted for, such as a mutable string.  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>StringDataInvolvesMemoryBlock</h1>
					<h2>StringDataInvolvesMemoryBlock As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not the string data in this instance is stored in some kind of a memory block, including a MemoryBlock, a mutable string, or a String.  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>

					<h2>StringDataInvolvesSwapFile As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not the string data in this instance is stored in a swap file.  Getting the value of this property does not affect the value of the LastErrorCode property.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit readonly">
					<h1>StringDataIsModifiable</h1>
					<h2>StringDataIsModifiable As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Tells whether or not the GetStreamAccess function has the ability to return a BinaryStream object with read/write access, or whether or not the ModifyValue method is unlikely to throw an IOException.  Of course, this does not mean you can forget about exceptions.  For example, if the data is stored on a hard drive, bad things can happen at any time.  If you set a BigStringKFS object to a BinaryStream, then this property is assumes True without testing anything.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>StringValue</h1>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>As mentioned above, this class is not designed for manipulating strings.  It is designed for being a common base for accessing strings.</p>
				<p>The reason this class exists lies almost completely with the convert constructors.  You can store a Folderitem, a MemoryBlock, a BinaryStream, or a plain old String into this class, and turn around and access the string data without knowing anything about where the data is coming from.</p>
				<p>For example, suppose you were creating a function that counts the number of Roman numerical digits in a string.  You might create it like this, with a String parameter:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Function DigitCount(text As String) As UInt64</p>
					<div class="codeblock">						<p>Dim result As Integer = 0</p>						<p>Dim myStream As BinaryStream = New BinaryStream( text )</p>						<p>Dim charCode As Integer</p>						<br />						<p>While Not myStream.EOF</p>
						<div class="codeblock">							<br />
							<p>charCode = myStream.Read(1)</p>							<br />							<p>If charCode >= 48 And charCode <= 57 Then result = result + 1</p>							<br />
						</div>						<p>Wend</p>						<br />						<p>Return result</p>					</div>					<p>End Function</p>				</div>
				<p>The above function takes a string as a parameter, and iterates through it one byte at a time using a BinaryStream.  If it finds a byte that is in the range of ASCII characters from 0 to 9 (corresponds to 48 through 57), then it increments the result variable.  Upon the conclusion of the loop, the result variable is returned.</p>
				<p>Now, what would you do if you wanted to get the DigitCount of the contents of a file?  You would probably open the file, read the contents into a String variable, and pass the String to the DigitCount function.  Although this approach works, it has some pitfalls.  First, it is inefficient.  It loads the entire file into memory and continues from there.  If you run out of memory, then too bad.  Second, if this function for some reason had the ability to exit early (which it can't), then you would not be able to get back the time you spent loading the whole file into memory.  The time you spent loading the remainder of the file into memory is wasted.</p>
				<p>One of the most obvious workarounds to this problem is to have another copy of the DigitCount function that takes a file instead of a String.  The new function would open the file directly using the same BinaryStream object that it would use in the loop.  The only problem is that this new function would also have to do some error checking when reading the stream.  One of the many important programming techniques I've learned is that a worker function should not care where its data is coming from.  Having two copies of the same function seems to contradict this idea.</p>
				<p>The BigStringKFS class provides a very well formed solution to this problem.  It represents a string, where the data can come from a variety of sources.  First, we must modify our DigitCount function to use a BigStringKFS class:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p class="ofinterest">Function DigitCount(text As BigStringKFS) As UInt64</p>
					<div class="codeblock">						<p>Dim result As Integer = 0</p>						<p class="ofinterest">Dim myStream As BinaryStream = text</p>						<p>Dim charCode As Integer</p>						<br />						<p class="ofinterest">If myStream = Nil Then Raise New IOException</p>						<br />						<p class="ofinterest">myStream.Position = 0</p>						<br />						<p>While Not myStream.EOF</p>
						<div class="codeblock">							<br />							<p>charCode = myStream.Read( 1 )</p>							<br />							<p>If charCode >= 48 And charCode <= 57 Then result = result + 1</p>							<br />
						</div>						<p>Wend</p>						<br />						<p>Return result</p>	
					</div>					<p>End Function</p>
				</div>
				<p>All that needed to be modified were the marked lines above.  Acquiring the BinaryStream object was easier, and we had to check for errors, and set the position of the stream to the beginning.  Other than that, everything is the same.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the usage of this function did not change at all.  The following are examples of using the DigitCount function with the BigStringKFS argument:</p>
				<div class="codeblock">
					<p>Dim file As Folderitem = SpecialFolder.Desktop.Child( "samplefile.txt" )</p>
					<p>Dim mb As MemoryBlock = "Testing; 1, 2, 3..."</p>
					<p>Dim myStream As BinaryStream = New BinaryStream( "Testing; 1, 2, 3..." )</p>
					<br />
					<p>// Get the DigitCount of a String:</p>
					<p>MsgBox Str( DigitCount( "Testing; 1, 2, 3..." ) ) // Displays 3</p>
					<br />
					<p>// Get the DigitCount of the contents of a file:</p>
					<p>MsgBox Str( DigitCount( file ) )</p>
					<br />
					<p>// Get the DigitCount of the contents of a MemoryBlock:</p>
					<p>MsgBox Str( DigitCount( mb ) ) // Displays 3</p>
					<br />
					<p>// Get the DigitCount of the contents of an arbitrary BinaryStream:</p>
					<p>MsgBox Str( DigitCount( myStream ) ) // Displays 3</p>
				</div>
				<p>In the above code, the String and MemoryBlock examples can be used with the original DigitCount function (MemoryBlocks can export to Strings).  Using a BigStringKFS parameter allows additionally being able to provide a Folderitem or a BinaryStream, with no change in the usage of the data later on.</p>

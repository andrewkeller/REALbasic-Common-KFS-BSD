			<h2>ResourceManagerKFS <span class=cd>(Interface)</span></h2>
			<p>The ResourceManagerKFS interface can be used when you want an object to be able to return an object corresponding to a given String key.  The behavior is simmilar to that of a Dictionary, except that this interface does not allow write access to the object.</p>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Fetch</h1>
					<h2>Fetch( key As String, ByRef value As Variant, ByRef persistenceCriteria As PersistenceCriteriaKFS ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>A method that should set the 'value' and 'persistenceCriteria' parameters to the values corresponding to the given key, and then return True.</p>
					<p>If the given key does not have a value associated with it, or does not have a value that is not expired, then the 'value' and 'persistenceCriteria' parameters should be set to Nil and the method should return False.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Get</h1>
					<h2>Get( key As String ) As Variant</h2>
					<p>A method that should return the value corresponding to the given key.</p>
					<p>If the given key does not have a value associated with it, or does not have a value that is not expired, then a ResourceNotFoundInManagerException should be raised.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Lookup</h1>
					<h2>Lookup( key As String, defaultValue As Variant ) As Variant</h2>
					<p>A method that should return the value corresponding to the given key.</p>

			<h2>AggregatingResourceManagerKFS <span class=cd>(Implements ResourceManagerKFS)</span></h2>
			<p>AggregatingResourceManagerKFS is an immutable implementation of the ResourceManagerKFS interface that only acquires its data from other ResourceManagerKFS objects.  In other words, this class aggregates multiple ResourceManagerKFS objects together into a single object, which itself is also a ResourceManagerKFS object.</p>
			
			<h2>Constructors</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>AggregatingResourceManagerKFS ...</h1>
					<h2>New SimpleResourceManagerKFS( listOfAggregateResourceManagers() As ResourceManagerKFS )</h2>
					<h2>New SimpleResourceManagerKFS( ParamArray listOfAggregateResourceManagers As ResourceManagerKFS )</h2>
					<p>Creates a new AggregatingResourceManagerKFS object that uses the given ResourceManagerKFS objects as aggregates.  This class is immutable; after you create a new AggregatingResourceManagerKFS object, you cannot change the list of aggregate ResourceManagerKFS objects.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<div class="attrlist">
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Fetch</h1>
					<h2>Fetch( key As String, ByRef value As Variant, ByRef cachingCriteria As CachingCriteriaKFS ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Searches all of the aggregates in order until one of them has the given key, sets the 'value' and 'cachingCriteria' parameters to the values reported by the found aggregate, and returns True without searching the rest of the aggregates.</p>
					<p>If the given key does not exist in any of the aggregates, then the 'value' and 'cachingCriteria' parameters are set to Nil and the method returns False.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Get</h1>
					<h2>Get( key As String ) As Variant</h2>
					<p>Searches all of the aggregates in order until one of them has the given key, and returns the value reported by the found aggregate without searching the rest of the aggregates.</p>
					<p>If the given key does not exist in any of the aggregates, then a ResourceNotFoundInManagerException is raised.</p>
					<p>This implementation uses the Fetch method of the aggregates rather than the Get method to avoid the overhead of handling exceptions.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>HasKey</h1>
					<h2>HasKey( key As String ) As Boolean</h2>
					<p>Searches all of the aggregates in order until one of them has the given key, and returns True without searching the rest of the aggregates.</p>
					<p>If the given key does not exist in any of the aggregates, then this method returns False.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>ListKeysAsArray</h1>
					<h2>ListKeysAsArray() As String()</h2>
					<p>Returns a finite list of all the keys that are accessible from this object.</p>
					<p>This method runs in O(n) time, where n is the total number of keys stored among all of the aggregates.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="unit">
					<h1>Lookup</h1>
					<h2>Lookup( key As String, defaultValue As Variant ) As Variant</h2>
					<p>Searches all of the aggregates in order until one of them has the given key, and returns the value reported by the found aggregate without searching the rest of the aggregates.</p>
					<p>If the given key does not exist in any of the aggregates, then the 'defaultValue' parameter is returned.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<div>
				<p>This class is compatible with Console, Desktop and Web applications, and should work on all platforms.</p>
				<p>This class is thread safe.</p>
				<p>This class is almost completely decoupled from the rest of this library.  All it requires is the ResourceManagerKFS interface.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Because this class requires that you provide all of the aggregates up front and never lets you add any later, it is impossible to create loops in the aggregate tree.  However, this class does not impose any guarantees for any subclass, where the immutable nature of this class could be circumvented.</p>
				<p>This class does not have any special protocol for handling a merge in the aggregate tree.  If there is a merge in the aggregate tree, then the node at the point of the merge and all of its aggregates will effectively be searched twice.  Normally, this is not an issue.  Even if the node at the point of the merge or one of its aggregates has the key that is being looked for, the search will end upon the first query and the second will never occur.  However, in the case where no node has has the key, the node at the point of the merge and its aggregates will all be queried twice.  This scenario cannot be averted because this class does not have the ability to see the aggregate tree, and thus cannot identify this scenario.</p>

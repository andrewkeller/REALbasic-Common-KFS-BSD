		<h2>Acquiring this library</h2>
		<p>This library is tracked using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, which means that there is no "central" server.  Instead, there are people who each have their own publicly available clone of this repository.</p>
		<p>With that said, there is only one currently known publicly available clone of this repository:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://github.com/andrewkeller/REALbasic-Common-KFS-BSD" target="_blank">Andrew Keller's clone, hosted on GitHub</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Most web interfaces for Git repositories allow you to browse history and download source code.</p>
		<h3>Downloading source code from a repository hosted on GitHub</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to the web page of the repository.</li>
			<li>(Optional) Navigate to the point in time where you would like to download source.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on "Commits".</li>
				<li>Find and click on the commit of your choice.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Click on the "Download Source" button.</li>
			<li>Click on the format of your choice.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Cloning a repository hosted on GitHub</h3>
		<p>For this action, I will assume you already know how to use Git to some extent.</p>
		<p>As you may already have guessed, all you need to know is the URL of the repository, which is usually not the same as the URL of the web interface.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to the web page of the repository.</li>
			<li>Right below the description of the repository, the clone URL of the repository is listed.  Click on "Git Read-Only".</li>
			<li>Copy and paste the URL that appears into whatever you are using to clone the repository.</li>
		</ol>
